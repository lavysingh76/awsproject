first check iptable list
sudo iptables -L
then 
sudo a2enmod ssl
restart the server
check ufw status if inactive active it
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
restart server 
install openssl
sudo apt install openssl
create ssl certificate
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/server.yourdomain.com.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/server.yourdomain.com.crt
answe the question
sudo cp -a /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
edit this file
<VirtualHost *:443>
        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
        # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
        # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
        #ServerName www.example.com

        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

        # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
        # error, crit, alert, emerg.
        # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
        # modules, e.g.
        #LogLevel info ssl:warn

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/server.yourdomain.com.key
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/server.yourdomain.com.crt

        # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
        # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
        # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
        # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
        # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
        #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
</VirtualHost>

Then, add these three lines:

SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/server.yourdomain.com.key
SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/server.yourdomain.com.crt

run this
sudo a2ensite 000-default.conf

sudo apache2ctl -t

sudo systemctl restart apache2
